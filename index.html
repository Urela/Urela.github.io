Once a project has utility outside of education, Orolo Labs shall become a research lab. Till then this is a portfolio

<h2>Thesis</h2>
<h3>Machine learning is not an API problem. </h3>
<p>
Suppose we have some computer vision model that provides some label to an image. This label (or category) is always 
designed by some human for humans. However edge cases exist - is a there a difference between a dagger and knife and 
does it matter? What if an assailant is carrying a fork.... well you we should be building a assailant detector.... No.
The answer is never a more sophisticated heuristic threat model. Rather our models should be outputing Policy or a Plan. 
Models should be responding to signals with phyiscs not fakes science! <br><br>

Models should not be treated as APIs or else the API will perform as well as the human who designed the model. I don't
want to get introuble for holding a pen that 'looks' like a pen <br><br>
