## An unfinished manifesto for reinforcement learning

Keeping with the theme of games - everything as a game. Life is some kind of game.  There are two distinct type of games that we care about
a) Games that are played for the purpose of winning. marked by a terminal state that maximises reward
b) Games that are played for the purpose of continuing play. Any game whose termianal states return less reward than states of play.

Play between these two games is different.
